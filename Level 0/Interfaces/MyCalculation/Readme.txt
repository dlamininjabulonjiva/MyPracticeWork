I have created a very simple calculation program with tests.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of interfaces. So I have created an interface with a few methods:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Division
- Multiplication

I also added a test builder to demonstrate the use of NSubstitute (Still getting a hang of this but getting better each day).
